# CKEditor Paste Filter

This module implements extra filtering of text pasted from Word. Yes, we have
the awesome Pastefromword CKEditor plugin now in the Drupal core. But the pasted
text is not perfect. It still has too many elements and redundant styles for
font family, font size, etc. This plugin will clean up your pasted from the
Word text without any side effects for other functionality. You can still
insert elements and change styles, although this depends on your format
filter allowances.

## Useful when

- You want to have clear html layout and good managed html elemnts with css
  styles after paste text from the Word.
